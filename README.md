# Project 4 Website Performance Optimization 

######Project Overview

This project is part of Udacity's [Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The task is to optimize a provided website with a number of optimization and performance-related issues so that it achieves a target PageSpeed score of 90 and runs at 60 frames per second.

######Summary
In this project I learned about the critical rendering path, the process by which the browser receives HTML, CSS and JavaScript and the required processing to turn them into rendered pixels. I used Chrome Developer Tools to review the current state of the application and iteratively make changes and test those changes to determine if they are a performance gain or loss.
